    "# Part 1: Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The subject of this case study is an investigation into inflection points for a dataset provided on May 8, 2020. That dataset contained daily sales data for several merchants, split between two different panels (PANEL_1 and PANEL_2) and two different transaction types (CREDIT and DEBIT).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal for the case study is to write code in Python that will identify inflections points for particular merchants on particular dates within the data, along with some indication as to how we should classify those inflection points. The structure of this document is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An overview of the problem.\n",
    "- Theoretical considerations that we will use to derive a solution along with a step-by-step overview for development of the code to achieve this.\n",
    "- A final, compact, summarized set of code that will combine all of the previous work done.\n",
    "- Analysis of the dataset in terms of how many inflection points there are, and how we classify them.\n",
    "- Final conclusions and some suggestions for future work on this project.\n",

    "# Part 2: Theoretical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an \"inflection point\" and how do we measure it?\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we need to come up with a reasonable idea as to what an \"inflection\" even is in the context of the data. Colloquially, people refer to inflection points as major turning points. If a person kicks a bada habit or starts a family, these can be said to be \"inflection points\" in that person's life. How does one measure inflection points in the life cycle of a business? Poetics aside, it would be convenient if we could arrive at some quantitative means for discerning inflection points and classifying them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, a framework exists that does precisely this. One may recall hearing about \"inflection points\" in your high school or college calculus class. In calculus, when we talk about a continuous, differentiable function, an **inflection point** is defined as a point at which the _concavity_ of the function changes. What this means is that the function either goes from being concave to convex, or vice versa. A **concave** function is one in which no line segment joining two points on the graph lies above the graph at any point, while a **convex** function is one in which no line segment joining two points on the graph lies below the graph at any point. Another way to put this is that a convex function \"holds water\" (think a U-shaped curve like a parabola) while a concave function does not \"hold water\" (think an n-shaped curve, like the negative absolute value function). \n",
    "\n",
    "How do we go about quantifying the concavity of a function? To do this, we use another calculus tool: the derivative. The **derivative** is the rate of change of a function and can be thought of as the slope of a line that is tangent to the curve at the given point. In general, if you have a continuous and differentiable function, $f(x)$, we can determimne the rate of change of the function by means of looking at its first derivative. If the first derivative is positive, it means that the function, at that point, is increasing. If the derivative is negative, it means that the function is decreasing at that point. Finally, if the derivative is 0, it means that the function value is neither increasing, nor decreasing; instead, it is constant. Visually, one can observe the magnitude of the first derivative of a function as the \"steepness\" of the curve: the steeper it is, the larger is the magntitude of the derivative, and the more dramatic is the rate of change.\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative is useful when one wants to find a local maximum or minimum for a function, but alone it will not tell us anything about its concavity. To investigate the concavity, we can take the derivative of the derivative, also known as the **second derivative** of the function. When this value is positive, it means that the function is convex; when it is negative, it means that the function is concave. If the second derivative changes sign from positive to negative or negative to positive, the function is changing its concavity at that point. It is **_this_** that indicates an inflection point.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we could discover a formula for the derivative of a function, then we could take the first derivative of the sales function and then take the derivative of that in order to ascertain the concavity. From there, we need to look for sign changes in the second derivative. So the first concern is how we will go about calculating the derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "By definiton, the derivative is given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{d}{{dx}}f\\left( x \\right) = \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{h \\to 0} \\frac{{f\\left( {x + h } \\right) - f\\left( x \\right)}}{h }$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the **difference quotient**, and it says that the derivative can be found by choosing a small value $h$ and looking at the change in the function when it moves from $x$ to $x+h$. We want to take the limit as $h$ gets smaller and smaller to approximate the derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, in real life we will always be working with some real step size that cannot be made infinitseimally small. In our data set, we have daily data, so it is natural to take the step size to be 1 day. Thus, we use $h$ = 1. Then we can approximate the derivative by taking the _difference_ of the original Sales series. Another question remains, though: Do we take the difference between the value of the function at its current location and that of its value in the next day, or we do the opposite and take the difference between the function and its previous day? Both are \"correct\" but will potentially yield different results. These are known as the **forward** and **backward** formulas, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to go, known by us through some numerical analysis, is to use more complex formulas for the numerical approximation of the derivative. These are the **3 point** and **5 point** formulas that can be derived from the Taylor series expansion for the function. The advantage of using these formulas is that for a small step size, $h$, the error becomes smaller. To be thorough, we will use all four of the above formulas for this case study in order to get an idea which are most effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we need a way to calculate the derivative using these four different methods. Generally, we will take as an input a Pandas dataframe consisting of 2 columns: the date and the corresponding sales. Of course, our function assumes that we have fixed the merchant, the panel, and the payment method, so that we can execute this function and then have some other, outer function deal with iterating through these combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have our first bit of code for this case study, which will approximate the derivative, as follows:"

Some days appear to be missing. This is not a showstopper, though, since we will be investigating each company separately, but it would be interesting to know why some of the data is missing for these merchants.\n",

Thus, we should write a helper function that will fix these dates and append a new field to the rawData for the FixedDate, which we will use going forward."

    "The first factor is the approach that we will use for calculating the derivative. As mentioned in the earlier section, there are 4 approaches: forward, backward, 3point and 5point. Aside from that, there is the fact that the we have options for partitioning the data based on two other fields: Panel and Type. For each of these, there are two values. Thus, for a given merchant, we need to decide which approach to use and then choose a partition scheme. The table below illustrates the available permutations:\n",

    "This is a total of 36 different permutations. Since there are 25 merchants, we have 25 x 36 = 900 different datasets to consider. We will not be able to consider all 900 in great detail in this case study, but we will be able to produce tools which will enable us to run all 900, in principle, if we want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is needed now is a general algorithm for processing any one of these 36 permutations for any of the 25 merchants in the dataset. Generally, one algorithm that will get the job done is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set data = rawData\n",

    "\n",
    "Of course, if we are doing a partition method where we are not partitioning by panel or type, then we would short-circuit that loop and set a default value for the factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to the code, we need to consider two additional things. First, what does it mean to \"report\" an inflection point? It means that we should know when it occurred, for what merchant it occurred, and how \"severe\" it is. If it was identified in a context where we partitioned the data by panel and/or type, we should also know those values as well. We should also be able to retrieve the sales that occurred on that day and the actual value of the second derivative at that point. Finally, we should know the **streak** for the second derivative. The streak is how long the second derivative kept its sign the same before it changed. This will help us to later classify how severe the changes in concavity were.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we need to remember that there are 4 methods for estimating the derivative (and the corresponding second derivative): the forward equation, the backward equation, the three-point equation, and the five-point equation.

    "From the above, it is clear that the backward and forward methods perform identically, so there is no difference there. As for the 3point and 5point methods, it appears as though they report fewer inflections than the backward and forward algorithms overall, with 3point actually consistently reporting fewer than 5point. This makes some sense if one considers that the backward and forward algorithms is a rougher approximation to the first and second derivatives (i.e. the error is larger for these estimations than the error for 3point and 5point).\n",

On the other hand, it is not clear which of the 3point and 5point methods are more reliable. Generally, the 5point tends to report more inflections, while the 3point tends to report fewer. 3point is less permissive than 5point.\n",

On the other hand, if we want to minimize the number of false positives, then it is better to go with the 3point method."

    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "As promised, we need to provide a few solid recommendations for how to proceed and some leads as to how to carry this analysis further.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, a word on which method to use in checking inflection points. From what we can see in the data, it appears as though the 3point and 5point methods should be selected over the backward and forward approaches. Whether we use the 3point or 5point approach depends on how permissive we want to be in selecting the inflection points. **If we want to err on the side of caution in reporting inflection points, then we should use the 3point method; otherwise, use the 5point method. This is our first decision.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Next comes the question of whether we want to partition the data or not. This is a nontrivial decision, and I would suggest that we do it as a preliminary check. When we partition the data, we can see the _relative volatility_ of the subset of the data that is partitioned. The reason for this is that the number of inflection points is an indication of how unstable or volatile the data are. If we were to partition the data on say, Panel, and we saw PANEL_1 had far more inflection points reported than PANEL_2, it would say that PANEL_1 is more volatile than PANEL_2. **As such, partitioning can help us to isolate the volatility across factors in our original data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, we can see that the number of inflection points reported for those cases where no partitioning is done is generally smaller than the number of inflection points reported for those cases where partitioning is done. The reason for this is that the different factors taken together are generally more stable (i.e. less volatile) over time, and therefore, we would expect there to be fewer inflection points. As a final guideline here, I would say that one should partition by panel and type to see whether we can isolate volatility in certain subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things that one can do to improve the work done in this case study to make the results more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, one can help to eliminate false positives by looking at seasonality in the data. Seasonality is a large topic with many possibilities. There can be seasonality within a given week (i.e., sales on weekends or Fridays can be more or less than sales on weekdays), seasonality within a given month (i.e. the first week of the month may generally see more or less activity than the last week of the month), and seasonality within a given year (i.e., sales may be concentrated within a few months of the year, say October to December, and may wane in the summer, or vice versa).\n",
    "\n",
    "A point worth mentioning with regards to seasonality and inflection points is that if one gets an inflection point that exists on a seasonal basis, this does not invalidate the fact that it is an inflection point. On the contrary, it is still an inflection point, but one might call it a _planned_ or _expected_ inflection point, as opposed to those inflection points that are unplanned and tied to certain \"black swan\" events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, one can leverage the streak field that was stored in the Inflection class to get some idea as to how gradual an inflection point is in time. On its own it can tell us how long a sales curve remains concave or convex, but technically, one could still have a sudden change in concavity despite the regularity preceding the change. Hence, streak on its own is not so useful. However, if we combine the streak field with a running _percent change_ field for the second derivative, we may be able to arrive at a better metric for determining how gradual or sudden an inflection point is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this is a complex task that can benefit from more attention."
